# ADS-502-Data-Mining-Final-Project
Classifying levels of chest pain based on Heart Attack Predicting data set from Kaggle.
The project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to explore descriptive statistics of each attribute, understand and consider outlier removal, and reveal the distribution of data for each feature.
Various modeling techniques were applied to predict for the feature "Chest Pain", such as decision trees, naive Bayes, and neural networks.
Using a test-train split, the model was validated using a holdout set.

This project was done in collaboration with Conor Fitzpatrick and Sreeja Kurapaty.
